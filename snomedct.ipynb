      "The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, as of April 2019, has the most articles of any edition. As of September 2020, 11% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages. As of 21 September 2020, there are 6,161,563 articles on the site, having surpassed the 6 million mark on 23 January 2020. In August 2019, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's articles amounted to 16.1 gigabytes.The Simple English Wikipedia (simplewiki) is a variation in which most articles use only basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (angwiki). Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.\n"

    "BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Schwarzer is a 72-year-old female with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma and inflammatory breast cancer of the left breast with a mass in the lung that is suggestive of likely stage IV disease who has also multiple other medical problem including diabetes , who presents with a two-day history of right and left finger warmth , tenderness and swelling. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Adriamycin and cytoxan and is status post cycle 2 on 10/28/06 and began to feel like she was recovering from her chemotherapy approximately three days prior to admission. A spinal MRI obtained on Tuesday to evaluate her spinal stenosis was uneventful but later on that day the patient developed redness on the dorsum of her right hand in the area in which her IV was placed per the MRI. The following morning the patient had a pustular lesion on the fourth digit of her right hand distal to the dorsal redness and went to EH Urgent Care where she received one dose of ceftriaxone and was given a p.o. script for Augmentin. She was sent home but at home she developed expulsive diarrhea and vomiting on that evening , was not able to tolerate her oral antibiotics. The next day she noticed a similar lesion on the fourth digit of her left hand looking much like that on the right hand. She returned to the TMHMC urgent care for one more dose of ceftriaxone and was then admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. The patient denies any cat bites , travel , soil or water contract.

    "were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was\n",
    "anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess\n",

    "stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with\n",
    "paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.\n",
    "Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV\n",
    "vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her\n",
    "finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within\n",
    "two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage\n",
    "of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing\n",
    "and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's\n",
    "vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient\n",
    "developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured\n",
    "approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an\n",
    "erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear\n",
    "to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar\n",
    "lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The\n",
    "patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious\n",
    "Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of\n",
    "the patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no\n",
    "vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The\n",
    "Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had\n",
    "paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation\n",
    "due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.\n",
    "The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially\n",
    "treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that\n",
    "were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic\n",
    "emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from\n",

    "and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient\n",
    "was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on\n",
    "Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether\n",
    "the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she\n",
    "was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and\n",
    "topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the\n",
    "right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were\n",
    "symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in\n",
    "addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.\n",

    "not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,\n",
    "and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.\n",
    "The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash\n",
    "developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to\n",
    "Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection\n",

    "BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Schwarzer is a 72-year-old female with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma and inflammatory breast cancer of the left breast with a mass in the lung that is suggestive of likely stage IV disease who has also multiple other medical problem including diabetes , who presents with a two-day history of right and left finger warmth , tenderness and swelling. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with Adriamycin and cytoxan and is status post cycle 2 on 10/28/06 and began to feel like she was recovering from her chemotherapy approximately three days prior to admission. A spinal MRI obtained on Tuesday to evaluate her spinal stenosis was uneventful but later on that day the patient developed redness on the dorsum of her right hand in the area in which her IV was placed per the MRI. The following morning the patient had a pustular lesion on the fourth digit of her right hand distal to the dorsal redness and went to EH Urgent Care where she received one dose of ceftriaxone and was given a p.o. script for Augmentin. She was sent home but at home she developed expulsive diarrhea and vomiting on that evening , was not able to tolerate her oral antibiotics. The next day she noticed a similar lesion on the fourth digit of her left hand looking much like that on the right hand. She returned to the TMHMC urgent care for one more dose of ceftriaxone and was then admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. The patient denies any cat bites , travel , soil or water contract.

    "were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was\n",
    "anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess\n",

    "paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.\n",
    "Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV\n",
    "vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her\n",
    "finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within\n",
    "two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage\n",
    "of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing\n",
    "and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's\n",
    "vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient\n",

    "approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an\n",
    "erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear\n",

    "Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had\n",
    "paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation\n",
    "due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.\n",

    "was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on\n",
    "Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether\n",
    "the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she\n",
    "was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and\n",
    "topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the\n",

    "not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,\n",
    "and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.\n",

    "developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to\n",
    "Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection\n",
